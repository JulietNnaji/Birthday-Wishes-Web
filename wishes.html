                    Vicky babyyy,
                    <br />
<br />
I’ve never met anyone who is so full of energy- witty, lovely and intelligent. I am very pleased and proud of you. The way I see things and then they remind me of you is rest intriguing because we haven’t met yet and I suppose the best people live far away.
Thank you for being so reliable and open minded and thank you  for always being so kind and being available to listen!
I pray that this new season favour you and God make the life you lead to be filled with blessings because you deserve nothing but the best!
Happy birthday Victoria Omotola Hussein 🥳🤎!

    As you like to say, Literary rage has become more that just some bookclub and is now our own small circle of amazing people-all thanks to you. I've gotten the most amazing people from that bookclub and I can't explain how much I love you because it wouldn't have happened without you.
<br />
<br />
Thank you for everything. And for being effortlessly funny. I love you🫶🏾
<br />
<br />
P.S.: my taste in books is fantabulous. Everyone else just needs to have good taste.
